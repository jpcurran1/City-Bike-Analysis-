# City-Bike-Analysis

For this homework I used a CSV file from the City Bike website with data from the month of Febuary. I leveraged Tableau public to import the data to create visuals and dashboards to display different phenomena. I personally thought it would interesting to leverage the data to learn about the indivudals who use City bikes--are they male, female, or unknown? How old are they? Are they members of city bike? How far are they riding based on age or gender? I tried to look at it from the persepctive of someone who works at city bike. If you knew more about who is riding your bikes and how they use them, you might be able to target your marketing efforts. For example if you knew you had many female riders who were not members, you could try marketing towards that group. Or if you knew you were not popular among 30 year olds, you could target your marketing effrots toward that group. 

Based on the data analysis I conducted, I had the following insights: 

# Data 
The data used was for Febuary 2021. All metics and dashboards are only showing Febuary 2021 data. 

# Gender Analysis
The Gender dashboard shows several metrics related to gender usage of citi bikes during the month of Feburary in 2021. It shows that the vast majority of rides are male which might be an indication citi bike needs to somehow appeal to more female riders. Based on these figures I would recomend doing market reserach to find out why so few females use citi bike to males and then based on those findings see if there could be targeted marketing or changes made to appeal more to females. 
# Age Analysis
I thought it would be interesting to do an age analysis to see what age groups used the bikes the most and to see if there were certain age pockets that are not using the bikes. However when doing the analyis and plotting the data, I think there is a more significant take-away. If you look at the histrogram there is a massive spike at the age of 52. After reading about the data I belive this is due to a default setting that populates that birth year if a rider leaves it blank. That same historgram lso tells us that most of users are not subscribers. This indicates that most people who don't complete the infomration are just customers. This could be an opportunity to maybe make it easier to enter data or to sign up as a subscriber to get these cutomers to become subscribers.
